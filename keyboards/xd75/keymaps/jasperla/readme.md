# Keymap for xd75 by jasperla

## Design decisions

As my build for this keyboard uses a wooden case nor did I place LEDs below the
switches there is no need for any LED control in this keymap.

I've also included some elements from my Ergodox layout (the `_PT` layer) which
allows for basic mouse and cursor movement. Another element is the off-by-one
placement of the `6` key which allows for the `_` to be mapped to the top right
of the board.
